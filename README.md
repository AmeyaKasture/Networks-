# Networks
This repository showcases different implementations of network concepts, including socket programming with multithreaded and polling implementations. The code is written in C language, reflecting a high level of proficiency in this language.

Implementations:
Multithreaded Socket Programming: This implementation demonstrates how to create a server-client model using multithreading in C. Multiple client connections are handled concurrently through separate threads, ensuring efficient communication and scalability.

Polling Socket Programming: The polling implementation illustrates how to use the poll() system call to manage multiple sockets efficiently in C. It allows for asynchronous I/O handling without the need for creating separate threads for each connection, which can be advantageous in certain scenarios.

Usage:
To compile and run the code, follow these steps:

1.Clone the repository to your local machine.  
2.Navigate to the directory containing the desired implementation.  
3.Compile the source code using a C compiler (e.g., GCC)
